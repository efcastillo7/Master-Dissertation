\section{Final Remarks}
\label{sec:final_remarks_kap3}

Initially, in this chapter, the fundamental concepts about KDN and RL (in particular Q-learning)  were described. This master dissertation considered these concepts for proposing a KDN-based architecture (IPro) that keeps CCO and CUC within predefined thresholds and maintains an acceptable MA. Subsequently, the IPro architecture and its architectural elements were introduced and detailed. Finally, the RL-based algorithm (its functioning, computational complexity, and interactions) that determines the probing interval considering network traffic variations, CCO, and CUC was presented.
