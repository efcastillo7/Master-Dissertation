\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{chapter:evaluation}
This chapter provides an extensive evaluation of the feasibility of using IPro as a practical approach (\textit{i.e.}, in terms of CCO, CUC, and MA) for intelligent probing in SDN. This chapter starts showing the test environment, including the SDN to monitor. After, this chapter presents the  IPro prototype developed and its impact (\textit{i.e.,} the change over the time of Probing Interval) in CCO, CUC, and MA (of the throughput) in the test environment. This chapter finishes showing the comparison of IPro with PPA and other adaptive approaches by quantitative and qualitative analysis, respectively.
