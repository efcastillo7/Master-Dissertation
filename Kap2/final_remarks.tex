\section{Final Remarks}
\label{sec:final_remarks_kap2}

Initially, in this chapter, the concept of the SDN  and the architectural features that make the SDN more flexible, scalable, efficient, and adaptable to the changing needs of the business were detailed. Subsequently, the fundamental concepts about TE and network monitoring in the SDN context were described, along with the monitoring techniques related to traffic collection. Finally, the ML concept was introduced, along with its categories and its use in the networking context. This master dissertation considers these concepts for proposing an approach (\textit{cf.} Chapter~\ref{chapter:intelligent_probing}) that focuses on optimizing the probing interval regarding CCO and CUC.
