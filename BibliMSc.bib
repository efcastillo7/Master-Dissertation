    abstract="Applications running in modern datacenters interact with the underlying network in complex ways, making administrators run multiple traffic management tasks to tune the system. However, today's traffic management solutions are limited by an artificial division between the hosts and the network. While network devices only have knowledge of the network layer, the hosts can provide more visibility into how applications interact with the network. This paper proposes to extend the scope of traffic management to the end-host network stack. We present a software-defined networking platform for joint HOst-NEtwork (HONE) traffic management. HONE presents a uniform view of a diverse collection of measurement data, minimizes measurement overhead by performing lazy materialization of fine-grained statistics, and scales the analysis by processing data locally on the end hosts. HONE offers a simple and expressive programming framework for network and service administrators. We evaluate HONE by implementing several canonical traffic management applications, measuring its efficiency with micro-benchmarks, and demonstrating its scalability with larger experiments on Amazon EC2.",

    abstract="In this paper we present OpenTM, a traffic matrix estimation system for OpenFlow networks. OpenTM uses built-in features provided in OpenFlow switches to directly and accurately measure the traffic matrix with a low overhead. Additionally, OpenTM uses the routing information learned from the OpenFlow controller to intelligently choose the switches from which to obtain flow statistics, thus reducing the load on switching elements. We explore several algorithms for choosing which switches to query, and demonstrate that there is a trade-off between accuracy of measurements, and the worst case maximum load on individual switches, i.e., the perfect load balancing scheme sometimes results in the worst estimate, and the best estimation can lead to worst case load distribution among switches. We show that a non-uniform distribution querying strategy that tends to query switches closer to the destination with a higher probability has a better performance compared to the uniform schemes. Our test-bed experiments show that for a stationary traffic matrix OpenTM normally converges within ten queries which is considerably faster than existing traffic matrix estimation techniques for traditional IP networks.",

    year={2014}, 
    pages={1-9}, 
    abstract={Software Defined Networking promises to simplify network management tasks by separating the control plane (a central controller) from the data plane (switches). OpenFlow has emerged as the de facto standard for communication between the controller and switches. Apart from providing flow control and communication interfaces, OpenFlow provides a flow level statistics collection mechanism from the data plane. It exposes a high level interface for per flow and aggregate statistics collection. Network applications can use this high level interface to monitor network status without being concerned about the low level details. In order to keep the switch design simple, this statistics collection mechanism is implemented as a pull-based service, i.e. network applications and in turn the controller has to periodically query the switches about flow statistics. The frequency of polling the switches determines monitoring accuracy and network overhead. In this paper, we focus on this trade-off between monitoring accuracy, timeliness and network overhead. We propose PayLess - a monitoring framework for SDN. PayLess provides a flexible RESTful API for flow statistics collection at different aggregation levels. It uses an adaptive statistics collection algorithm that delivers highly accurate information in real-time without incurring significant network overhead. We utilize the Floodlight controller's API to implement the proposed monitoring framework. The effectiveness of our solution is demonstrated through emulations in Mininet.},

    abstract={New and different trends in networks have been promoted in recent years, among these, Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) has emerged as an initiative from the industry (manufacturers and network operators) in order to increase the flexibility of deployment and integration of new network services within operator's networks. This is achieved through the implementation of network functions such as firewalls, encryption, filtering, load balancing, among others, via software modules. The idea is to avoid using devices based in specific hardware appliances and increase return on investment. Transforming network functions in software allows to run them on different general purpose equipment that could be located in a variety of telecommunications infrastructure, including data centers, network nodes, and even in end-user facilities, also such network functions can be moved or migrated from one equipment to another easily without the need to install new specialized hardware. This article presents a state of the art on network functions virtualization, also it proposes a classification of the main projects that are working under this paradigm. Finally, use cases and future challenges in this area are discussed.},

    abstract = "Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging networking paradigm that separates the network control plane from the data forwarding plane with the promise to dramatically improve network resource utilization, simplify network management, reduce operating cost, and promote innovation and evolution. Although traffic engineering techniques have been widely exploited in the past and current data networks, such as ATM networks and IP/MPLS networks, to optimize the performance of communication networks by dynamically analyzing, predicting, and regulating the behavior of the transmitted data, the unique features of SDN require new traffic engineering techniques that exploit the global network view, status, and flow patterns/characteristics available for better traffic control and management. This paper surveys the state-of-the-art in traffic engineering for SDNs, and mainly focuses on four thrusts including flow management, fault tolerance, topology update, and traffic analysis/characterization. In addition, some existing and representative traffic engineering tools from both industry and academia are explained. Moreover, open research issues for the realization of SDN traffic engineering solutions are discussed in detail."

Routing optimization plays a key role in traffic engineering, finding efficient routes so as to achieve the desired network performance. In this survey we review Internet traffic engineering from the perspective of routing optimization. A taxonomy of routing algorithms in the literature is provided, dating from the advent of the TE concept in the late 1990s. We classify the algorithms into multiple dimensions: unicast/multicast, intra-/inter- domain, IP-/MPLS-based and offline/online TE schemes. In addition, we investigate some important traffic engineering issues, including robustness, TE interactions, and interoperability with overlay selfish routing. In addition to a review of existing solutions, we also point out some challenges in TE operation and important issues that are worthy of investigation in future research activities.},
