\section{Methodology and Organization}
\label{sec:methodology}

Figure \ref{fig:scientific_research_process} depicts the phases of the scientific research process followed in this master dissertation: Problem Statement, Hypothesis Construction, Experimentation, Conclusion, and Publication. In Problem Statement, the research question has been identified and defined. In Hypothesis Construction, the hypothesis and associated fundamental question have been formulated. Furthermore, in such a phase, the conceptual and technological proposals have been defined and carried out. In Experimentation, the hypothesis and evaluation results have been tested and analyzed, respectively. In Conclusion, conclusions and future works have been outlined. Note that Hypothesis Construction has been refed after Experimentation and Conclusion. In Publish Findings, papers for renowned conferences and journals have been submitted and published. This document was also written during such last phase.
