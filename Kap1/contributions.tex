The investigation about a practical approach for intelligent probing in SDN led to the following major contributions.

\begin{itemize}
     \item A KDN-based architecture that provides an efficient solution for tuning the probing interval in SDN. This tuning keeps CCO and CUC within predefined thresholds and provides an acceptable MA.
    \item A RL-based algorithm that determines the probing interval considering network traffic variations, CCO, and CUC.
    \item An IPro prototype that implements the proposed architecture.
\end{itemize}

The above-mentioned contributions were reported to the scientific community through paper submissions to renowned journals (see Appendix A).
