\subsection{General Objective}

To introduce a mechanism for intelligent probing in SDN by Machine Learning techniques.

\subsection{Specific Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
    \item To design a mechanism based on Machine Learning for intelligent probing in SDN.
    \item To implement a prototype of the proposed mechanism.
    \item To evaluate the mechanism through of a prototype in an SDN emulated scenario according to its network monitoring accuracy and network overhead.
    %\item To evaluate the prototype in a particular emulated scenario according to its performance, efficiency \footnote{In network management, efficiency is measured concerning traffic statistics and response times. It is also evident that depending on the Machine Learning techniques used will be necessary to use specific metrics; these metrics will be defined in the development of the research.} and effectiveness.
\end{itemize}
